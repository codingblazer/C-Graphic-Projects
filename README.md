# C-Graphics Projects 

These projects were developed using C-Graphics Library. I spent most of my time in Graphics Lab working on these projects.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game 

This Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a **GUI** based C game which can be played using keyboard controls. The game algorithm is designed such that the player can never win it.

## Catch the Blocks Game

This Game is also a GUI based C game which can be played using keyboard controls like arrow keys. The player has to catch the blocks that are coming from random locations. The game ends if user misses more than 5 blocks.

## ScreenSaver 

This is a 2d screensaver built in C graphics. In this screensaver, the arcs are made which moves by following certain equations. I was learning geometric equations in my Mathematics class and used 3 equations from the class. 

The equation is of a point having locus as a circular path which in turn has locus as a elliptical path. So, I have used arcs (instead of point) which moves in a circular path and circular path is also continously moving in another elliptical path. The below gif image will give better understanding.
